Ideas:

Change sprite renderer to store the actual reference to the renderer on the create method
change to a render queue instead
look at adding scenes as well as layers
look at creating own texture class which holds things like: texture source dimensions, the scale or destination dimensions, etc.
add an init stage that initis the textures of the engine, this is default textures such as a no texture texture etc.

Letf to do:
	- Try add zombie sounds
	- Zombie and player rotation and animation
	- Blood effects when shot or hit
	- (Addition) could try add zombie limbs that stay for a bit after zombie dies or takes damage
	- Potentailly better graphics on the start and death screen
	- Better perk art 
	- Pack a punch?
	- Add player health to HUD (DONE - CHECK)
	- Perk indication at the bottom on the hud (DONE)
	- Pickup indication in the hud (DONE)


Bugs:
	- Health bar does not disappear, need to make sure that the bar fills up all the way as I think it might be capped half way.
