Ideas:

Change sprite renderer to store the actual reference to the renderer on the create method
change to a render queue instead
look at adding scenes as well as layers
look at creating own texture class which holds things like: texture source dimensions, the scale or destination dimensions, etc.
add an init stage that initis the textures of the engine, this is default textures such as a no texture texture etc.
